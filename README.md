# PowerBI to Google Slides Automation Guide

This guide explains how to automate getting PowerBI visuals into Google Slides with titles, slide numbers, and proper formatting, using PowerBI PDF export, a Python GUI, and a Google Apps Script.

---

## Step 1: Export PowerBI Report to PDF

- Open your PowerBI report.
- Go to the export menu and export as PDF (entire report or selected pages).
- Save the PDF to your computer.

---

## Step 2: Convert PDF Pages to Named PNGs Using Python GUI

- Install required Python libraries:
  - `pip install pymupdf pdfplumber`
- Use the provided Python script with a simple GUI to:
  - Select your exported PDF file.
  - Choose an output folder.
  - The script will convert each PDF page to a PNG, using the first line of text on the page as the filename (safely sanitized and truncated to 50 characters).
- Result: Each PowerBI visual is saved as a separate PNG, clearly named after its report or chart title.

## Step 3: Prepare Your Google Slides Template

- Create a new Google Slides presentation.
- Add a single template slide containing:
  - A text box labeled `Title` (to be replaced by the PNG filename/title).
  - A text box labeled `1` (to be replaced by the slide number).
  - An image or shape labeled `PowerBI Image` (to be replaced by the PNG).
- Format and style this template slide as you wish; it will be duplicated for each PNG/chart.

---

## Step 4: Upload PNGs to Google Drive

- Create a new folder in Google Drive.
- Upload all PNGs generated by the Python script into this folder.

---

## Step 5: Run the Google Apps Script to Populate Slides

- Open your Google Slides template.
- Go to Extensions → Apps Script and paste in the provided `.gs` code.
  - Update `templateId` with your Slides file ID.
  - Update `folderId` with your Google Drive folder ID.
- Run the script.
  - For each PNG file:
    - Duplicates the template slide.
    - Replaces the image placeholder with the PNG (keeps position and size).
    - Replaces the `Title` box with the PNG file name (from the PowerBI visual).
    - Numbers the slides in order.
- (Optional) Remove the original template slide after the process.

## Workflow Summary

1. **PowerBI → PDF:** Export report as PDF.
2. **PDF → PNGs:** Use Python GUI to convert PDF pages to titled PNG files.
3. **PNGs → Google Drive:** Upload PNGs to a Drive folder.
4. **Slides Template:** Ensure your template slide is set up.
5. **Apps Script:** Run the script to generate all slides, titled and numbered.

## Notes & Tips

- The first line of your PowerBI page or visual becomes the PNG and slide title.
- PNGs are sorted alphabetically; if you need a specific order, adjust naming accordingly.
- Update the Apps Script only when template or Drive folder changes.
- This process ensures rapid, repeatable creation of visually consistent, titled Google Slides for any PowerBI report.
